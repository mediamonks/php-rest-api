# MediaMonks Rest API

This library contains an event subscriber to easily create a Rest API with the [Symfony HttpKernel](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_kernel.html). 
By default this library will output according to our [MediaMonks Rest API spec](https://github.com/mediamonks/documents) but since we believe it could be very useful for other companies too it's very easy to extend it or implement your own.

## Highlights

- Scalars, arrays and objects will be converted automatically
- Thrown exceptions will be converted automatically
- Supports custom serializers like JMS, uses json serializer by default
- Supports custom response models
- Supports application/json, application/x-www-form-urlencoded & multipart/form-data input
- Supports method overriding
- Supports forcing a "200 OK" status method
- Supports paginated responses
- Supports wrapping json response in a method (jsonp) and post message
- Should work with any framework that uses HttpKernel

## Documentation

Documentation and examples can be found in the [/docs](/docs) folder.

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.3

To use the library.

## Installation

Install this package by using Composer.
